/*About the program: This program simulates an assembler. It gets a list of files names, (using the arguments in command line). Each file contains an assembly language code. It reads and analyzes the code line by line from each file, so at the end of reading proccess, the program prints detailed error messages, if any, or alternatively export files as required: object file (=contains the memory image of the machine code), entries file, externals file, (as detailed later in the program).
Assumptions: *Source files names with '.as' extension. *Each source program provided as input has a possible maximum size. *Excess "white spaces" are ignored in an assembly language input file. *Lowercase and upper case letters are considered different in the assembly language. *Assembly language supports the representation of integers on a decimal base only. *There must be a white character separating (one or more) between command/label and operands, except commas.*/

And if no errors were detected, the functions for exporting appropriate output is called. one file is open each round.
Algorithm: creating a "file descriptor"-file pointer for operations on files: fopen(), fscanf(), feof()- in order to know when the file ends, fclose() and more. argc- stores the amount of input parameters in command line. argv[i]- holds each time a file name.*/
